# 🛡️ Nemitra AI  
### *Your Visionary Friend That Sees Threats Before You Do*

---

## 🌟 What does “Nemitra” mean?

**Nemitra** comes from Sanskrit, meaning **“Good Friend”**, **“Guide”**, or **“Trusted Companion”**.

So **Nemitra AI** means:

> 🤝 **An intelligent friend who protects you on the internet**  
> 👁️ **A visionary guide who sees digital threats before you do**  

Just like a real friend warns you before danger, **Nemitra AI warns users before they click on malicious links.**

## 🚀 About The Project

**Nemitra AI** is an **AI-powered cybersecurity MVP web application** designed to **analyze URLs and detect phishing, scam, and malicious links** before users interact with them.

In today’s world, phishing websites look **almost identical** to real banking, social media, and payment websites. One wrong click can:

- Steal passwords  
- Drain bank accounts  
- Hijack social media  
- Infect systems with malware  

**Nemitra AI solves this by acting as a smart pre-click security layer.**

It analyzes every URL using:
- Heuristic security rules
- Brand impersonation detection
- URL structure analysis
- Domain trust logic
- Risk scoring engine
- And a **simulated Azure AI Security layer (for MVP / demo)**

Finally, it shows:
- ✅ Risk Score (0–100)
- 🚦 Verdict: SAFE / SUSPICIOUS / DANGEROUS
- 🧠 Clear reasons why the link is risky or safe
- 🕓 Scan history for the user

## 🏆 Built For

- 🏅 **Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026**
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity innovation
- 🤖 AI for social good
- 🌐 Phishing awareness & prevention

## 🧠 How Nemitra AI Works (In Simple Words)

When a user enters a URL:

1. The system simulates **Azure AI security analysis**
2. Then runs multiple **security checks**:
   - Phishing keywords (login, verify, bonus, bank, etc.)
   - Brand impersonation (fake Google, PayPal, SBI, etc.)
   - Suspicious domains (`.xyz`, `.click`, `.top`, etc.)
   - IP-based URLs
   - Long and malformed URLs
   - `@` symbol and double slash tricks
   - Trusted domain & bank domain trust rules
3. A **risk score (0–100)** is calculated
4. The system shows:
   - Status badge
   - Risk meter
   - Exact reasons
5. The scan is saved in **local history**

> ⚠️ Currently this is an **MVP / Prototype**. In real production, this will be connected to real Azure OpenAI, Threat Intelligence APIs, and cloud backend.
